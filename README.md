# reversi-dart-client
 Runing the program has two options
  1. `dart ./main.dart host playerNumber aiType(random)`
  2.  `dart2nativate ./main.dart` and then `./main.exe host playerNumber aiType(random)` 
  
To create your own AI:
1. Create a new class that extends ReversiAi (ai/reversi_ai.dart)
2. Add your ai to the if statement found in main.dart
